                <h2 style="text-align: center"><strong><f4>Principal's Message</f4></strong></h2>
                <h3 style="text-align: center"><f5>“Learning gives creativity, Creativity leads to thinking, Thinking leads to knowledge, Knowledge makes you great.” ~ <strong>Dr.A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</strong></f5></h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify"><f3>It is often said that, 'Knowledge is power'. Although there has always been a debate on this matter, but the importance of education cannot be denied. Education matters so much for us because it not only provides us financial stability, but also brings refinement in our culture. Education helps us with many things, but most importantly, it empowers an individual to think, question, and see beyond the obvious. Human beings are born with a natural tendency to question. Education is the best way to satiate our curiosity, without extinguishing the burning desire to learn and explore more.</f3>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify"><f3>I also have been an educator for several years and hence I support the pivotal, proactive role an educational organisation of repute plays in today’s society. I feel honoured to be in charge of a seat of learning that can mould the most significant resource of any nation i.e. the young, impressionable human minds, our children. It will be appreciated by all that the overall development of the child is not possible only at School.</f3>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify"><f3>In fact the first education for a child starts at home. Hence, I feel it is of utmost importance that the parents also participate and interact with teachers and contribute in the growth and development of their child. In a collaborative effort, we want children to thrive in all ways possible. Our expectations will be to consistently make sure you are aware of your child’s progress, and answer any questions or concerns you have at any time. This form of two-way monitoring will help ensure the success of your child’s education and well-being.</f3>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify"><f3>India being a diversified nation with various traditions and cultures, it is of utmost importance that our rich culture and values are passed on to the next generation. This will make our children proud of our rich heritage and will strengthen their roots. If the roots are strong, no one can stop the tree to grow and flourish.</f3>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify"><f3>Our school is filled with dedicated professional staff committed to providing the students with a quality education. We provide a balanced environment focused on shaping children into leaders of tomorrow by offering comprehensive education through a developmental approach. The school environment promotes order, independence, a love for learning, a connection to the world and a sense of social responsibility.</f3>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify"><f3>As a principal it will always be my mission to put kids first! My belief is that all students can learn, and it is our job to support all of their needs. As educators, we always endeavour on how each child learns in order to differentiate our instruction to support diverse learning styles. I also want all children to love school. I promise to provide a learning environment that is positive, safe, caring, a fun place to learn and grow. My goal is also to provide our students the essentials needed for success in a safe and warm environment. My team at NCS Vizag will work together with the priority of having every student’s best interest at heart.</f3>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify"><f3>Let us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation - John F. Kennedy.</f3>
